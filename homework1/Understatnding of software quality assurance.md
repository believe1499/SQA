    In my opinion, an overall understanding of "software quality assurance" is like the book said do the right things and do the things right. Software quality ma include many different attributes and may be defined and perceived differently based on people's different roles and responsibilities. The goal of software quality assurance is to achieve high-quality software product. Quality assurance makes difference in whole software development life cycle. 
    For most software development organizations, ensuring quality means dealing with defects. There are three generic ways to deal with defects include :
	- defect prevention;
	- defect detection and removal;
	- defect containment.

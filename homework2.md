#Chapter 4
<hr>
This chapter mainly talks about  defect handling during the execution of specific QA activities and examine how different QA activities fit into different software processes.

The most important activity associated with defect handling is defect resolution, which
ensures that each discovered defect is corrected or taken care of through appropriate actions.
Each corrected or fixed defect needs to be re-verified to ensure failure-free executions under
the same execution conditions.

QA activities form an integral part of the overall software process. We next examine the
different ways that software QA activities can be carried out and integrated into different
types of software development and maintenance processes.

#Chapter 5
<hr>
In this chapter, we mainly learned some other major activities associated with quality assurance (QA) for software systems, primarily in the areas of setting quality goals, planning for QA, monitoring QA activities, and providing feedback for project management and quality improvement.

Indirect quality measures are those which can be used in various quality models to assess and predict quality, through their established relations to direct quality measures based on historical data or data from other sources.

Various parallel and post-QA activities are carried out to close the quality engineering loop. The primary purpose of these activities is to provide quality assessment and feedback so that various management decisions, such as product release, can be made and possible quality and process improvement initiatives can be carried out.

The quality engineering process forms an integral part of the overall software engineering process, where other concerns, such as cost and schedule, are also considered and managed.

#Chapter 6
<hr>
The basic idea of testing involves the execution of software and the observation of its behavior or outcome. If a failure is observed, the execution record is analyzed to locate and fix the fault(s) that caused the failure. Otherwise, we gain some confidence that the software under testing is more likely to fulfill its designated functions. We cover basic concepts, issues, and techniques related to testing in this chapter.

In the overall framework of software quality engineering, testing is an integral part of the QA activities. In our classification scheme based on different ways of dealing with defects in Chapter 3, testing falls into the category of defect reduction alternatives that also include inspection and various static and dynamic analyses. Unlike inspection, testing detects faults indirectly through the execution of software instead of critical examination used in inspection. However, testing and inspection often finds different kinds of problems, and may be more effective under different circumstances. Therefore, inspection and testing should be viewed more as complementary QA alternatives instead of competing ones.

The main difference between functional and structural testing is the perspective and the related focus: Functional testing focus on the external behavior of a software system or its various components, while viewing the object to be tested as a black-box that prevents us from seeing the contents inside. On the other hand, structural testing focus on the internal implementation, while viewing the object to be tested as a white-box that allows us to see the contents inside.
